## Quick Responses for Common Questions

**"Is this another shitcoin?"**
```
Open source GitHub + working product + real utility. Check the code yourself: charleebitmyfinger/xray-token-scanner
```

**"Why Monad?"**
```
Sub-second scanning. Ethereum's too slow for real-time whale tracking. Speed kills in crypto.
```

**"Token utility?"**
```
Hold $XRAY = unlock premium scanning features. Utility that makes sense - better tools = better plays = more money.
```

**"How's the hackathon going?"**
```
Agent + Token track, judges love it because it solves real problems instead of creating another yield farm.
