# Twitter Threads - $XRAY Token Scanner

## Thread 1: "The Whale Hunter" 🐋☠️

**Hook:**
GM degens. You know that feeling when you're about to ape into a token but your gut's screaming something's off? Yeah, that's your brain telling you you're flying blind. Not anymore.

**Thread:**
2/ Ever wonder why your bags keep getting rugged? It's not bad luck. It's information asymmetry. Whales see everything. You see a green candle and hope.

3/ Meet $XRAY - it's like having X-ray vision for crypto. Literally CT scanning tokens to show you exactly where the whales are hiding.

4/ Before you ape into that "100x gem" - scan it. See whale concentration, risk scores, AI analysis. Know if you're about to become exit liquidity or if you're early.

5/ Built on @monad_xyz because speed matters when you're hunting alpha. Sub-second scans while others are still loading etherscan.

6/ Here's the kicker: Hold $XRAY tokens = unlock premium features. It's like having a VIP pass to alpha before it hits CT.

7/ DYOR doesn't mean staring at charts until you're cross-eyed. It means using tools that actually give you an edge.

8/ Ready to stop being exit liquidity? Scan before you ape.

## Thread 2: "Rug Pull Prevention System" 🚫💸

**Hook:**
Every 2.6 seconds, a degen gets rugged. This tweet could have saved them $2.3M collectively. Here's the tool that spots rugs before they pull:

**Thread:**
2/ Thread of rugs that $XRAY would have caught:
- Token X: 87% whale concentration = obvious dump incoming
- Token Y: Smart contract red flags = honeypot detected
- Token Z: 73% supply held by 3 wallets = coordinated exit

3/ We're not talking about basic token sniffer shit. $XRAY uses AI analysis + whale tracking + risk scoring = actual alpha.

4/ Think of it as your personal due diligence team, but it works 24/7 and doesn't charge you 2% management fees.

5/ Built for @MoltiverseHack because crypto needs better tools, not more influencers shilling their bags.

6/ The best part? You don't need to trust us. It's open source. Check the code, verify the scans, see the alpha yourself.

7/ But here's where it gets spicy: Hold $XRAY tokens and you unlock features that make you the whale instead of whale food.

8/ Stop praying your bags don't get rugged. Start knowing.
Scan first, ape second.

## Thread 3: "From Exit Liquidity to Whale" 🐳➡️

**Hook:**
Your biggest problem isn't finding 100x plays. It's knowing which ones won't rugged before you 100x. Here's how $XRAY flips the script:

**Thread:**
2/ Most tools tell you what happened. $XRAY tells you what's about to happen.
- Whale accumulation patterns
- Risk scoring before market moves
- AI analysis that spots manipulation

3/ We're not here to replace your gut instinct. We're here to give it actual data to work with instead of hopium and chart astrology.

4/ Built on Monad because when you're tracking whale movements, every millisecond matters. Ethereum's too slow for real alpha.

5/ The game theory is beautiful: Hold $XRAY tokens → unlock premium scanning → find better plays → make more money → hold more $XRAY.

6/ This isn't another "utility token" that exists to justify a token. This is a tool that gets better the more you use it and the ecosystem grows.

7/ Currently in @MoltiverseHack competing in Agent + Token track. Judges love it because it actually solves a real problem instead of creating another yield farm.

8/ From exit liquidity to whale hunter. The tool exists. The alpha is here. Question is: are you ready to stop being the exit liquidity?
