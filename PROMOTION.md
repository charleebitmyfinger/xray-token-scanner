## What is $XRAY?

$XRAY Token Scanner is the CT scanner for crypto - giving you the same vision that whales have, but designed for regular degens. We built this because we were tired of watching our community get rekt by projects designed to separate them from their money.

## The Problem We're Solving

Every day, degens get absolutely demolished not because they're stupid, but because they're flying blind. While whales can see every wallet, every transaction, every move, regular traders are making decisions based on green candles and Twitter influencers.

$XRAY changes that equation.

## How It Works

### Core Features
- **Whale Concentration Analysis** - See if 3 wallets hold 80% of supply before you ape
- **AI-Powered Risk Scoring** - Spot rugs before they happen with 15+ risk factors
- **Real-time Scanning** - Built on Monad for sub-second analysis
- **Pattern Recognition** - Not just "red flags" but actual behavioral analysis

### Technical Innovation
- **Monad blockchain** - High-performance chain for real-time analysis
- **Multi-source data** - Combines Monad RPC + Nad.fun API
- **Advanced risk calculation** - 0-100 risk score with detailed insights
- **RESTful API** - Easy integration for other tools and bots

### Risk Factors Analyzed
1. **Security Risks (30%)** - Honeypot detection, taxes, mint functions
2. **Holder Concentration (25%)** - Whale percentages, distribution analysis
3. **Liquidity Risks (20%)** - Depth, volume, market stability
4. **Age Risks (15%)** - New token penalties, launch timing
5. **Social Risks (10%)** - Community size, engagement, legitimacy

## Token Utility

This isn't charity - the tokenomics actually make sense:
- **Hold $XRAY** → Unlock premium scanner features
- **Premium features** → Get better alpha
- **Better alpha** → Make more money  
- **Make more money** → Hold more $XRAY

It's a flywheel that turns regular degens into whales over time.

## How to Use the Scanner

### Quick Start
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/scan/TOKEN_ADDRESS
```

### Web Interface
Visit the token page on Nad.fun to see real-time analysis: [https://nad.fun/tokens/0xD50229E9594B4A4B5F456fdC5759510c763F7777](https://nad.fun/tokens/0xD50229E9594B4A4B5F456fdC5759510c763F7777)

### API Endpoints
- `GET /scan/:tokenAddress` - Full token analysis
- `GET /health` - Server health check

### Integration Example
```javascript
const TokenAnalyzer = require('./src/scanner/tokenAnalyzer');
const analyzer = new TokenAnalyzer();
const analysis = await analyzer.analyze(tokenAddress);
console.log(`Risk Score: ${analysis.risk.score}/100`);
```
